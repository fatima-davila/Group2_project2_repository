# Project Summary
The Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT) currently uses a Microsoft Excel sheet to perform calculations for concrete mix design. NDOT wishes to migrate this calculation work to a Python-based system, which is the goal of this project. The Python program will prompt users to enter material properties and design parameters in a step-by-step manner, and then it will produce an automatically generated weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete.

By transferring its concrete mix design calculations from Excel to Python, NDOT intends to improve the reliability of its mix design process. Migrating to Python will ensure that the logic used in calculations is fixed, transparent, and repeatable. This will make the calculation logic more suitable for use in a future web-based tool.
